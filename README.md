# Qingdao in Data Science Research 

This is a data science project about my hometown [Qingdao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qingdao), China. The purpose of the project is to do some research on top of all kinds of raw data that I collected, and give a detailed but interested report about Qingdao. 

Skills needed: some stats, data cleaning, machine learning, Data mining, data clustering, data visualization, and reporting.

Some of the big questions I tried to solve are:

- The status quo of the real estate market (of course people care about how the real estate market goes!)
- *...will add more...*

### Dataset:

- Real estate part:

  Most of the data in this part I crawled from one of the famous brokerage website: [链家网](https://qd.lianjia.com/ershoufang/). 

  - `lianjia100.csv` contains the houses that are currently listed in the market. There were 44033 houses in the market yet due to the limitation of the website, only ~3000 houses were shown. 
  - `lianjiaDeal.csv` contains the houses that are already made in deal in the past. ~ 3000 records.
